======================
Bonfire Documentation
======================

Bonfire is a way to build static websites with little effort.

It is suited for programmers/techy types who 

 * Write infrequently.
 * Do not like to maintain a blog
 * Do not like the look and feel of blogs (Blogjunk?)
 * But want to tweak the system when they want to
 * want to abstract the maintenance of website as much as possible ;)
