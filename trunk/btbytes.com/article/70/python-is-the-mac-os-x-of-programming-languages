				<h1>Python is the Mac OS X of programming Languages</h1>
				
					<p><a href="http://www.prescod.net/">Paul Prescod</a> ruminates  <a href="http://www.prescod.net/python/IsPythonLisp.html">On the Relationship Between Python and Lisp</a> .</p>

	<p>He also gives succinct theory on why Python came to be a easy to learn/use language without having to sacrifice the power:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Resolve to succeed.</li>
		<li>Make the tool feel like an easy tool but provide the hooks to go deep for those who want something more complicated</li>
		<li>Talk to users.</li>
		<li>Sweat the details.</li>
		<li>admit that experienced programmers will have to relearn some things.</li>
		<li>admit that you cannot always make all categories equally happy.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>At the outset all these points seem to be &#8216;obvious&#8217;. Why wouldn&#8217;t anybody not do these things?  I guess,the most important point in the above list is <strong>sweat the details</strong> . More often than not, we take the easier route because it&#8217;s already &#8216;known&#8217; and who wants to do all the plumbing? </p>
