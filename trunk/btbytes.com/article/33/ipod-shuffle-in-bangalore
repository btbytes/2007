Thats a bit pricey considering that in the US, the same players would cost you $99 and $149 respectively.  Its a good buy considering the other flash based alternatives.</p>

	<p><strong>My concern</strong> : Linux does not have native &#8216;iTunes&#8217; software. The Open Source alternative <a href="http://gtkpod.sourceforge.net">GTKpod</a> , which works well with the hard drive based ones, seems to be not working with the Flash based ones. Probably i&#8217;ll wait till the GTKPod issue is sorted out. </p>

An open source venture into porting Linux onto the iPod <br />
The bootloader allows for you to choose between either iPodLinux or Apple&#8217;s firmware each time you turn on your iPod. iPodLinux is currently safe to install on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation iPods.<br />
