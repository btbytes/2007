				<h1>n plugins that make Firefox the coolest browser</h1>
				
					<p>An on going discovery of Firefox plugins that make browsing the World Wide Web useful, easy and pleasurable. </p>

	<p><a href="http://delicious.mozdev.org/"><strong>del.icio.us</strong></a><br />
A Plug-in that allows you to bookmak your pages and store them on line with the <a href="http://del.icio.us">http://del.icio.us</a> service. <br />
In my opinion, del.icio.us is the next best thing that happened to the internet since google. Visually explore my del.icio.us world at <a href="http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi?name=btbytes">http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi?name=btbytes</a></p>

	<p><a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/"><strong>AdBlock</strong></a><br />
Firefox is known for its in built ability to block popups. But what about ads that appear on the web pages themselves? I visit some sites almost on a daily(hourly? slashdot :) basis.  It would be nice read articles without all the flash movies and animated gifs distracting me.  <br />
Adblock allows you to block images/ flash images from web pages. To block a flash movie just click on the adblock tab that is augomagically attached to it and you can banish the ad forever!.  Note: it would be nice to adblock truly <strong>intrusive</strong> ads. Help your favourite sites sustain their ad revenue.</p>

	<p><a href="http://quicknote.mozdev.org/"><strong>QuickNote</strong></a><br />
Allows you to keep notes. A virtual sticky pad that keeps the notes even when you close your browser window and restart. Very handy to make quick notes. </p>

	<p><a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/fireftp"><strong>FireFTP</strong></a><br />
A full fledged FTP client that runs on top of Firefox. Enough said. </p>

	<p><a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/webmailcompose"><strong>WebmailCompose</strong></a><br />
want to mail a piece of text you found on the net to your collegue/friend? <br />
Its as easy as selecting the text and selecing webmailcompose from the context menu (right-click ->menu). </p>

	<p><a href="http://spellbound.sourceforge.net"><strong>Spell Bound</strong></a><br />
Spell Bound is a spell checker for Firefox and Mozilla browsers.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.iosart.com/foxytunes/firefox/"><strong>FoxyTunes</strong></a><br />
Emacs users are proud of the fact that, they can do almost anything from with in the emacs environment. Firefox users are getting there too :). With FoxyTunes you can control your music player(winamp, itunes, windows media player, amarok&#8230;almost any player you can think of) without leaving your browser. </p>

	<p>There is a new plugin built on top of Firefox/Mozilla almost everyday. The XUL/XPCOM architecture makes it a snap to write plugins. <br />
