<strong>Ten Reasons Why Blogging is Good For Your Career</strong></p>

	<p>1. You have to get noticed to get promoted.</p>

	<p>2. You have to get noticed to get hired.</p>

	<p>3. It really impresses people when you say &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve written about that, just google for XXX and I&rsquo;m on the top page&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh, just google my name.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>4. No matter how great you are, your career depends on communicating. The way to get better at anything, including communication, is by practicing. Blogging is good practice.</p>

	<p>5. Bloggers are better-informed than non-bloggers. Knowing more is a career advantage.</p>

	<p>6. Knowing more also means you&rsquo;re more likely to hear about interesting jobs coming open.</p>

	<p>7. Networking is good for your career. Blogging is a good way to meet people.</p>

	<p>8. If you&rsquo;re an engineer, blogging puts you in intimate contact with a worse-is-better 80/20 success story. Understanding this mode of technology adoption can only help you.</p>

	<p>9. If you&rsquo;re in marketing, you&rsquo;ll need to understand how its rules are changing as a result of the current whirlwind, which nobody does, but bloggers are at least somewhat less baffled.</p>

	<p>10. It&rsquo;s a lot harder to fire someone who has a public voice, because it will be noticed.</p>

That was interesting. <br />
I agree that most of what Tim said is US centric. Blogs are still a very niche thing in India. And most employers still don&#8217;t get it.</p></body></html>
