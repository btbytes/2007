				<h1>kalAtmaka janapada and the creative commons</h1>
				
					<p><a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">creative commons</a> is a flexible way of sharing your work of art (literature, fine arts) so that other s can learn, share and build upon your work; at the same time, honouring the original contributor and as a corollary, the subsequent contributor&#8217;s contribution to the evolving art form. </p>

	<p>This concept is similar to  our &#8220;janapada&#8221; tradition, in spirit, where the original author is unknown, yet the art lives on, for centuries. </p>

	<p>However, the creative commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/">differs</a> by allowing the user to share &#8216;some rights&#8217; with the author in place of traditional copyright system&#8217;s &#8211; &#8216;All rights Reserved&#8217; philosophy. </p>

	<p>Keeping this in mind,  appropriate word for Creative Commons in Kannada would be <strong>kalaatmaka janapada</strong>. </p>

	<p>note: We need to translate the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/">CC licenses</a> to kannada some time soon.  </p>
