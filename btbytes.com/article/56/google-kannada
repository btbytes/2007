				<h1>Google Kannada</h1>
				
					<p>You must have noticed the Indian languages list at <a href="http://google.co.in">google.co.in</a> . Kannada does not figure in that list yet. So, I went and checked <a href="http://services.google.com/tcbin/tc.py">the status</a> of kannada translation. <br />
The irony of it is, the main site translation is almost 70% done with another 185 messages left to do. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;m starting the translation effort today.  If you are a Kannadadiga who wants to contribute to Kannada&#8217;s presence online please put in a few hours. Later we can follow up with google to update the google.co.in site to have  kannada search functionality.  </p>

	<p><strong>update</strong> : if a few of us get together for 3-4 hours we can easily &#8216;Finish-off&#8217; this task AND we can have fun doing it. Imagine all the guffaws we will be having when trying to translate words to kannada&#8230; hmm.. whats the word for &#8216;Developer&#8217; again? :) </p>
