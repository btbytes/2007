				<h1>the git</h1>
				
					<p>Linux founder and leader Linus Torvalds has launched <a href="http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1852076002;fp;16;fpid;0">a new tool, called Git</a> , to manage his software project, after a dispute led him to drop the previous system.&#8217;</p>

	<p>*As usual, Torvalds is at his best &#8230; *<br />
When asked why he called the new software, &#8220;git,&#8221; British slang meaning &#8220;a rotten person,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m an egotistical bastard, so I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.&#8221; </p>
