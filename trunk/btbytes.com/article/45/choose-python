				<h1>Choose Python</h1>
				
					<p>Choose Python. Choose readability.<br />
Choose the simple over the complex and<br />
the complex over the complicated. Choose<br />
dynamic typing. Choose duck typing.<br />
Choose decorators. Choose generators.<br />
Choose metaclasses if you don&#8217;t value<br />
your sanity. Choose to import this. Choose<br />
an almost-fanatical devotion to the BDFL,<br />
unless he comes up with something like<br />
optional static typing, in which case choose<br />
to whine about it in your blog until he stops.<br />
Choose Effbot. Choose Timbot. Choose<br />
wx. Choose to come up with a bloody im-<br />
plementation before spouting off on<br />
comp.lang.python or Python-Dev. Choose<br />
the explicit rather than the implicit. Choose<br />
one obvious way to do it, especially if you<br />
are Dutch. Choose list comprehensions.<br />
Choose Paul Graham&#8217;s essays and<br />
s/LISP/Python/g. Choose Jython when<br />
your marketing people choose Java.<br />
Choose speed of development over speed<br />
of execution, but when in doubt, import<br />
psyco. Choose to finish early and laugh at<br />
your colleagues as they waste their miser-<br />
able lives bowing down in subservience to<br />
that sadistic little C++ compiler.<br />
Choose your <i>future</i><br />
Choose Python.</p>
