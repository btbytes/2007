				<h1>Agile India 2005</h1>
				
					<p>I read <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-beck/">Kent Beck</a> s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201616416/">Extreme Programming Explained</a> <br />
more than an year back. Paired programming appealed to me immediately. Gradually, I&#8217;m moving towards writing test driven programs. Writing test cases for existing code is a pain. I&#8217;m looking forward to <a href="http://www.agileindia.org">Agile India 2005</a> to <a href="http://202.53.78.202/agile2005/program.html">learn more</a> about the best practices from the XP/Agile world. <br />
If you are into Extreme Programming/Agile methods, and if you are from Bangalore, you definitely wouldn&#8217;t want to miss out on this one. The <a href="http://202.53.78.202/agile2005/registration.html">registrations</a>  are open . <br />
Incidentally, the conference is at my college <a href="http://www.pes.edu">PESIT</a>. <br />
I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672324415/">Extreme Programming in 24  Hours</a> by Steward Baird from the new <a href="http://sapnaonline.com/">Sapna</a> book shop in Jayanagr IV block. Hoping to finish that book by this month-end. </p>
