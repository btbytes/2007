<h1 class="title">Playing with the $5 VPSVillage VPS account</h1>
<p>I'm a happy camper with <a class="reference" href="http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net">nearlyfreespeech.net</a> for all my blog hosting needs. I host <a class="reference" href="http://www.btbytes.com">this site</a> (wordpress) as well as <a class="reference" href="http://konkanirecipes.com">my wife's recipe site</a> (Textpattern) &amp; <a class="reference" href="http://osbasket.com">OSBasket.com</a> (TP)and <a class="reference" href="http://madhu.savinudi.org">Madhu's Music blog</a> (WP)on NFS. For low traffic, low maintainance websites, NFS is a great bargain and fantastic to use.</p>
<p>However, when I want to play around with Django/Pylons using any <cite>non-standard</cite> setups like mod_python etc., NFS or even Dreamhost, which I used to use earlier fall short. I remember hosting a django app on DH using FastCGI, but was not impressed with the fastcgi process getting killed often.</p>
<p>So, something like VPSVillage is nice to have to hack on side projects and see how they look &quot;Live&quot; without shelling out $$s.</p>
<p>I requested a VPSvillage $5 account (64M RAM, 4GB HD) on Nov 13th and got my account today (26th). In fact, I had forgotten all about VPSVillage after sending a reminder 3 days after my  first booking.</p>
<p>Today, I got a mail from Grokthis.net</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Sorry for the wait, I've instructed billing to apply a 1-month credit for service as
a sign of   appreciation for your patience.

</pre>
<p>That was nice of them, but I've already ordered a <a class="reference" href="http://www.linode.com">Linode 300</a> VPS. Let me see how VPSVillage stacks for a $5 offering.</p>
<p>First thing I did was to log on to the VPS management console, which unlike <a class="reference" href="http://www.linode.com">Linode's</a> nice web driven dashboard, provides a bare bones shell.</p>
<p>It has options like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
  The following commands are available within this shell:
     boot - Boot the Xen guest.
 console - Gain access to a Xen guest via the serial console.
    exit - Exit the shell.
    help - Show general, or command-specific, help information.
  passwd - Change the password used to access this host.
    quit - Exit this shell.
  reboot - Reboot the Xen guest.
 reimage - Reset your system to a pristine installation.
  serial - Gain access to the Xen guest via the serial console.
shutdown - Shutdown the Xen guest.
  status - Show the status of the Xen guest.
  uptime - Show the uptime information of your guest system and this host.
</pre>
<p>The commands are self-explanatory. I reimaged the Xen VPS with debian-etch with XFS and 32 bit OS, since I had read that 64 bit OSes end up consuming more memory. The installation went fine but for one error related to a (??)thread.so file. This prevented me from installing further packages.</p>
<p>So, I removed that image too and installed ubuntu-feisty</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
RAM Size: 64
Swap Size: 128
Disk Size: 4G
Filesystem: ext3
Operating System: ubuntu-feisty, 32-bit
</pre>
<p>I logged into the VPS as root and ran <cite>apt-get update</cite>. So far so good.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at the available resources after a stock Ubuntu OS installation on this machine:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
<p>We have about 7MB of RAM before the system hits Swap memory. So, have to carefully choose what softwares we run here.</p>
<p>For a low diet system like this, one has to choose the components carefully. <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/">NGINX</a> is a small, fast and well written web server which I have come to like. I have successfully used it as a reverse proxy with Pylons as well as Plone (with Pound for caching).</p>
<p>I installed NGINX from source using:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ wget http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.6.17.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf nginx-0.6.17.tar.gz
$ cd nginx-0.6.17
$ ./configure
checking for OS
  + Linux 2.6.18-3-xen-vserver-amd64 x86_64
checking for C compiler ... not found

./configure: error: C compiler gcc is not found
</pre>
<p>Oops! no compiler tools installed yet. Lets remedy that:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ apt-get install build-essential

Configuration summary
+ threads are not used
+ PCRE library is not found
+ OpenSSL library is not used
+ md5 library is not used
+ sha1 library is not used
+ zlib library is not found
</pre>
<p>Let us install a few of the above:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ apt-get install libpcre3-dev #installs PCRE lib
$ apt-get install zlib1g-dev   #installs zlib
</pre>
<p>Compile and install:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
<p>This would install the NGINX software at <cite>/usr/local/nginx</cite>. To test the installation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cd /usr/local/nginx/
$ sbin/nginx
</pre>
<p>This will start the server on port 80. You can visit the IP of your system and should see</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Welcome to nginx!
</pre>
<p>Voila! you web server is up and running. Firefox's <a class="reference" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2036">Serverspy</a> extension tells me that the server is running NGINX0.6.17.</p>
