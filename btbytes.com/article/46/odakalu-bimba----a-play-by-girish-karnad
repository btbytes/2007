				<h1>oDakalu bimba -  a play by Girish Karnad</h1>
				
					<p><strike> Today </strike> Thursday evening I&#8217;m going to <a href="http://www.rangashankara.org">Ranga Shankara</a> to watch Kannada play <strong>oDakalu bimba</strong> by master playwright <strong>Girish Karnad</strong>.<br />
The play features <strong>Arundhati Nag</strong> . You can catch it on 22,23, 24th of this month.  I also have my eyes on &#8220;Gokula nirgamana&#8221; by pu.ti.na enacted by <strong>benaka</strong> on Thursday,31 March 2005. Play starts at 7:30 PM. Dont be late!<br />

<strong>Update</strong>: Some one from Ranga Shankara sent me a BIG poster of the play. Thank you.  Hmm&#8230; Only if they had sent a ticket earlier in the day, I could have been watching the play instead of writing this update :)  [We  had to postpone the visit to Thursday as <a href="http://rravikiran.blogspot.com">RK</a>  could not get the tickets even though he was at the theatre by 4PM]</p>

	<p>Interestingly,  If you  google for <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=ranga+shankara">Ranga Shankara</a> , you will notice that <a href="http://btbytes.com">this site</a> appears just after <a href="http://rangashankara.org">Ranga Shankara</a> .</p>

sorry to say&#8230;but we can&#8217;t even go  on thursday as all the tickets are booked. due to corporate publicity ticktes are not available at all&#8230;i went today and got hold of last few tickets of saturday(that was the best i could get)...that would be in english&#8230;<br />
sorry to disappoint, but something is better than nothing&#8230;what say ?<br />
some info on the play: this play is written exclusively for RS and is the first production by RS itself. also, Girish Karnad&#8217;s first direction of his own play!<br />
see you on saturday :)<br />
