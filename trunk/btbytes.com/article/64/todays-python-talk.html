				<h1>Today's Python talk</h1>
				
					<p>Today, I gave a talk on Python &#8211; &#8220;An Introduction to the Python Programming Language&#8221; at Global Academy of Technology, Bangalore. <br />
The audience (~60) were mostly the final year students of Info Sci. and Comp.Sci . Even if 5 out of 60 choose to do their final year projects using Python, I would consider my talk <strong>very</strong> successful. </p>

	<p>Its always exciting to talk about Python, especially to those who are burdened with C/C++.  I had to rush through the talk because I did not want to hold them back on a Saturday afternoon :).  </p>

	<p>I must be getting better  at giving talks on Python.  Its my third in 3 months :). <br />
The next one (on wxPython GUI toolkit )  is on 21st May, in the BangPypers&#8217; May Meetup. </p>
