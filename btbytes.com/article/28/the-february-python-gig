				<h1>The February Python gig</h1>
				
					<p>The next Python outing in Bangalore will be the <a href="http://python.meetup.com/158">BangPypers</a> meet on 19th Feb. DONT PANIC!! Python&#8217;s don&#8217;t bite. They just hug very warmly :). Jokes apart, <br />
, BangPypers is the short name for <strong>Bangalore Pythonistas</strong>; a cool collection of geeks from across the IT industry spectrum bound by the shared enthusiasm for our favourite programming language &#8211; <a href="http://www.python.org">PYTHON</a> <br />
The evolving agenda for the group is to popularise the python language, learn and share new and powerful features of the language on an on-going basis, contribute to Free/Open Source Software through Python and promote professional use of Python. And last but not but the least, have fun while doing all that heavy crunching :)<br />
The first formal BangPypers meet will be on 19th feb 2005. See the <a href="http://python.meetup.com/158">meetup</a> page for venue and time. Please RSVP if you are attending. <br />
I&#8217;ll be talking on &#8216;Functional Programming in Python&#8217;. Anand Pillai will be generating new interest on  &#8216;Generators &#38; generator expressions&#8217;  and Premshree Pillai will be cooking some &#8216;yammy&#8217; :) stuff with <a href="http://yaml.org">YAML</a> and <a href="http://pyyaml.org">pyyaml</a>. <br />
Each talk will be followed by Q&#38;A sessions and a BoF(Birds of Feather) session at the end of talks. <br />
