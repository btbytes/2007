				<h1>Python in Calicut</h1>
				
					<p>I&#8217;m back from Calicut after giving a talk on Python @ NIT Calicut&#8217;s Free/Libre Open Source software meet. Me and  <a href="http://www.swaroopch.info">Swaroop</a> talked about Python for nearly 3 hours. Going by the number of questions that were asked and the students approaching us to talk in the lunch break, I&#8217;m sure there are a new bunch of Pythonistas in Calicut :) This was my largest audience so far with nearly 150 people comprising of students and staff. </p>

	<p>Later in the day, <a href="http://shankarbalan.net">Shanker Balan</a> talked about the &#8216;other&#8217; free OS &#8211; The *BSDs. Followed by a very energetic and convincing talk on Open Source in India by <a href="http://atulchitnis.net">Atul Chitnis</a> </p>

	<p>The NIT Campus is huge. After the urban claustrophobia, the campus was liberating. I&#8217;m thankful to Prof MohanDas for inviting us and congrats to Dilip and Praveen on superbly managing the whole show. </p>

	<p><a href="http://www.swaroopch.info">Swaroop</a> has two exhaustive posts on the trip . There are  some fantastic (read wallpaper-quality) photos as well as the slides of the talk. We were a good team on-stage, delivering the talk. Looking forward to more such gigs. What say dude? :)</p>
