				<h1>Some thoughts on Yahoo</h1>
				
					<p>Yahoo <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=562&#38;ncid=738&#38;e=6&#38;u=/ap/20050323/ap_on_hi_te/yahoo_upgrades">increases</a> the mailbox size to 1GB.  While Yahoo! have been pretty nimble recently, especially with the <a href="http://search.yahoo.com">improved search</a> , <a href="http://flickr.com">aquiring flickr</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com">yahoo! API</a> , <a href="http://toolbar.yahoo.com/firefox">firefox toolbar</a> , their email service has to go a looong way before they can tempt new users ( No thanks, I already have *6* <em>current and active</em> email IDs :)  ). </p>

	<p>Some of the things that would make me use more of my existing Yahoo id, </p>
	<ul>
	<li> So, you have increased the email space to 1GB. But whats killer about <em>that</em> ?. </li>
		<li>Integrate y! mail, y! chat and 360 (whenever that&#8217;s ready)  so that i can search my emails, chats, my  blogs ,external  blogs i&#8217;ve syndicated in <em>my yahoo!</em> . ( Think of Gnome&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nat.org/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> project here.)</li>
		<li>Integrate Flickr! into my Yahoo! mail search. For example, when I search for <a href="http://bangpypers.org">bangpypers</a> , i should also get to see the photos of bangpypers meetups,  stored in <em>my</em> flickr account or my contact&#8217;s accounts.  <strong>Its the RSS people&#8230;</strong></li>
		<li>I&#8217;m very keen about seeing the chat session being saved as &#8216;conversations&#8217; in my yahoo mailbox and being able read/search.  No, saving sessions on to the disk some how does <em>not</em> work out. </li>
		<li>Remove all the ads, make the interface really lightweight </li>
		<li>put POP access back; that was the reason I started using Yahoo! in the first place</li>
		<li>Add intelligent search to email <em>ala</em> gmail . This should be trivial to yahoo</li>
	</ul>

	<p>After a long time, I&#8217;m rooting for Yahoo!. Perhaps, I look to yahoo! as being a competetive underdog. Or, is that because I know <a href="http://swaroopch.info">quite</a> <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/premshree">a few</a> <a href="http://yashman.rediffblogs.com/">Yahoo!s</a> now?</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, google is playing catch up in some areas and seems to be running into <a href="http://clsc.net/research/google-302-page-hijack.htm">problems</a> (302 page hijacking)</p>

That was a painful period when pop was removed, and we went in search of other id(entities).Nothing really matches &#8220;pop access&#8221; and I would let go <strong>any</strong> feature for pop(esp with multiple accounts).Pop was the syndication for email!<br />
Ps: yahoo.co.in still gives pop access :)</p><p><a href="http://www.swaroopch.info" id="38"> Swaroop C H </a> on 2005-03-26 00:45:01 said :<br/> Damn, we both talked about mail in the span of a few days.<br />
<br />
The Y! Mail team is taking too long to bring updates but I&#8217;ve been hearing they&#8217;re up to a lot of stuff. Hopefully, it is soon rather than later. I *<strong>badly</strong>* want a threaded view in Y! Mail.</p><p><a href="http://btbytes.com" id="39"> Pradeep </a> on 2005-03-26 01:42:23 said :<br/> Yahoo! gave a demo of 360 today to some select people. They have integratged chat, photos and of course the blog stuff.. <br />
cool! I guessed correctly :)</p></body></html>
