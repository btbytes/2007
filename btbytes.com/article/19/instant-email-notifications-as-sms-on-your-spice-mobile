				<h1>Instant Email notifications as SMS on your Spice mobile</h1>
				
					<p>I&#8217;ve been a user of Spice GSM services since October 2004. Till now I&#8217;ve had no complaints what so ever with their service. The network coverage is excellent in South Bangalore, where I live and I hear its the same in most parts of Bangalore. <br />
The only place where I had problems with Spice Network was inside The Forum in Koramangala. If someone from Spice is reading this, Please add a tower near Forum. It IS an important commercial hub. Comapratively, my friends&#8217; Airtel networks were strong in the same spot (to be exact, the Kalmane Kofee shop). </p>

	<p><strong>The Email notification service</strong><br />
This must be one of the least used(known?) services that are offered by Spice.  It works like this. You can open a email account with spice, like any other email provider like yahoo or rediff. Got to &#8220;myspice&#8221; at  <a href="http://www.spicetele.com">spicetele.com</a> . You can ofcourse give out this email address to your friends and you can use it as a regular webmail service. But, the interesting part is the &#8220;email notification feature&#8221;. Through which you can receive notices of all the eamils that are delivered to your spice account. You will get a mail from 555 / 19001 number stating the sender, subject and a bit of the message. You can also set filters to the emails you want to receive. </p>

	<p><strong>Cool!</strong><br />
You might say, &#8220;Well&#8230; that&#8217;s cool, but who would want to give this new ID to everybody again?&#8221;. <em>ahem!</em> thats where you need to hack the idea a bit. </p>

	<p>What mails do you want to see very urgently, as soon as you get them? <br />
If you have been a email user for any considerable amount of time, you would have mulitple email accounts. One for the class yahoogroups, one for the close friends and business, etc.,. So, you decide which emails you want to see on the jiffy and then set that email service to auto forward the emails to your spice account, and voila! you will get your mails in your SMS. <br />
The only caveat to this service is, you can not reply to the message. It could be done easily though. I would be glad to help them with the programs  if I&#8217;m asked to ;). <br />
If done correctly they can offer a &#8220;Hutch/outlook&#8221; kind of service on their existing infrastructure. Its not rocket science, really!<br />
While this may not have all the functionality of calendaring and stuff, imagine offering on-the-go instant email services to everybody, irrespective of their handsets. This will be a very useful feature to a lot of people. </p>

	<p>I also like Spice because they promote a lot of Karnataka/Kannada related activities. They have managed to create a very nice &#8216;Kannadiga&#8217; feel to their ads. And they have a &#8216;propah&#8217; Kannada customer service too (I use the Kannada service everytime I call their customer service :) ). Yeah! its sentimental but hey! I like it. </p>

	<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://tarunsblog.blogspot.com">Tarun</a> pointed out that, the SMS facility is available on MSN and Yahoo!. I dont know about MSN, because I&#8217;ve not used MSN earlier [and wont be using it in this century :) ], but Yahoo! does have a feature to forward your emails to your mobile. But this is a PAID service. Even rediff has a feature where you can send SMS&#8217;s to mobile phones .But thats a different service. <br />
The service Spice is offering is Free and it works independent of your email provider, as long as they provide forwarding facility(for eg: gmail) . </p>

	<p>Speaking of gmail, I have <strong>Six</strong> gmail invites left. Send me a <a href="http://btbytes.com/contact/13/contact">note</a> if you want one for yourself. </p>

	<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is only my experience as a Spice user of 3 months. Your mileage may vary. I&#8217;m not an employee of Spice.</p>

just wanted to add FYI that MSN India (msn.co.in) was also offering this service with your hotmail accounts. They give you the option of setting the alerts so that only those addresses in your contact list generate an alert. Yahoo India has this too&#8230;But for some reason, Hotmail is no longer alerting me on my mobile :-(</p><p><a href="http://cognizant.com" id="17"> Party </a> on 2005-01-31 14:37:51 said :<br/> hi</p><p><a href="http://saa" id="55"> rdda </a> on 2005-06-04 03:44:37 said :<br/> hi</p></body></html>
